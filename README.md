You can clone the repo:

Then you have to choose your favorite IDE and open your terminal to create a virtual env (first you need to be inside 
the repo folder): 
- either use conda ``conda create -n my_env python=3.8.0`` then `activate my_env`
- or use pyenv to install python3.8 with ``pyenv install 3.8.0`` (if you don't know how to install pyenv, check [this](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv))
- then use ``python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`` to create the environment 
- to activate it, : ``source venv/bin/activate``

Once your virtual env is created and activated, you can download the required packages by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you're all set, enjoy!
